This project aims to develop a custom gun controller for first-person shooter games using Arduino, enhancing gameplay with realistic controls and immersive features. The controller will integrate a trigger, joystick, buttons, motion sensors (gyroscope/accelerometer), and haptic feedback (vibration and LEDs) to simulate actions like shooting, aiming, and reloading. Using Arduino Micro/Leonardo for HID functionality, it will communicate seamlessly with games via USB or Bluetooth. The project involves designing an ergonomic gun layout, assembling hardware components, programming the controller, and integrating it with popular games. With clear documentation and a replicable design, this project offers an innovative and engaging gaming accessory for FPS enthusiasts.
